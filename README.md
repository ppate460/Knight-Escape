# Knight ♞ Escape ␛:

The objective of this game is to get the white knight ♞ to the empty
square in the upper right-hand corner of the board.

The knight can only move in the way that it does during a traditional
chess game. This means that a knight can only move in a valid L-shape
(two squares in a horizontal direction, then one in a vertical direction OR 
two squares in a vertical direction, then one in a horizontal direction).
